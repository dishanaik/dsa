## Tips for development

### Notes
- Think before you write
- Order matters - Execution is done step by step
- Think in steps towards the solution if it is not straight forward
- Keep context in mind - be aware of the data structure and data
- Never say `don't know`, never give up 
- Having the right attitude is the key
- Never get stuck without any thought in mind. If one way is closed, come back and find another way
- Think about edge cases for every step
- Keep in mind all the programming constructs and also all the functions available
- Dont think about which you already know.
- DRY
